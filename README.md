<p>To run this game, you'll need python installed. I coded this in v3.8.2.<br>
From the command line, you can navigate to the src folder and run the following command:<br>

To play the game, you have to have more than 1 player.</p>

## 1. Declare the number of players which are playing

## 3. Perform turn actions which follow these instructions

* Kick in the door.
* This has a chance to encounter a monster, item, or curse.
* Items and curses don't have to be shown to other parties but monsters do.
* If it is a monster, you must have equal or greater power than the monster to defeat it.
* Players may apply modifiers to the monster to make it stronger.
* If the player cannot defeat the monster with their power or by playing cards in their hand, they have two options:
* Ask other players for assistance and split the loot.
* Run away from the monster and lose a level.
* If the player defeats the monster, draw the number of loot and gain the number of levels.
* If it is an item or curse, you can kick the door in again or play a monster card from your hand.


## 4. Loot the room and add the card to your hand

* Acquire a random card from the loot table which can be any of the following:<br>
* Weapons
* Classes
* Races
